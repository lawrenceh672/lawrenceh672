- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Larry
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python to explore computer programming
- My focus in on a multi threaded python application that handles everything including user input onto separate threads
- To explore this idea I'm making a system to classify images from video frames to train the camera in the future to classify observed images
